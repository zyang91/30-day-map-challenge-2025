# Day 1 of 30 Day Map Challenge - Point Map

Day 1: I mapped the Penn's campus and health system core facilities using R `leaflet` packages and geocoded with GoogleMap geolocated API. Due to University data protection and security request, the raw data source cannot be shared publicly. The data is made available through CPLN6810:  Anchor Institutions as Agents of Change: Past, Present and Future, taught by Dr. Genie Birch and Prof. Tony Sorrentino, and sponsored by Penn Institute for Urban Research.
