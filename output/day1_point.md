# Day 1 of 30 Day Map Challenge - Point Map

**Day 1 (Point)**: I mapped the University of Pennsylvania campus and Penn Medicine’s core facilities using R’s `leaflet` and the `Google Maps Geocoding API` via Python. Due to university data protection requirements, the raw dataset isn’t public. The data was made available through *CPLN6810, Anchor Institutions as Agents of Change: Past, Present, and Future* (taught by Dr. Genie Birch and Prof. Tony Sorrentino) and sponsored by the Penn Institute for Urban Research.
